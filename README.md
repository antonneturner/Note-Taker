I created this Note taker to showcase my talents as well present my creations to future employers.
My motivation in creating this note taker is to showcase my skills and talents and continually learn and improve.
This project was created to enhance my skills and to continue to push myself to learn and grow. To take notes and see my progress from project to project, a before and after one can say.
I learned how to use express and javascript on the backend side to create dynamic usage and push it up to the front end of html by creating routes that direct users to the html and api's of the website. I also learned how to upload this project to Heroku.
